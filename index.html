            <ul style="list-style-type: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
                <li>
                    <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
                    <p>I love <a href="climb.html">rockclimbing</a>. It is absolutely the best sport ever invented. How
                        else can you be in such
                        beautiful places, push yourself mentally and physically, and never have to pay a dime!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Volleyball</h3>
                    <p>I've played a lot of volleyball; it used to be my raison d'etre. I guess I never got higher than
                        about the A level with
                        <abbr title="USA Volleyball Association">USVBA</abbr> or grass doubles, but I really loved it. I
                        still do, but don't play much anymore.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Triathlons</h3>
                    <p>I was a swimmer in college, a runner all through life, and a cyclist from about 1990 to 1995. So
                        doing triathlons was a
                        natural thing for me; I've only done about 5 of them, but I want to do more some day. My longest
                        one contained a 1 mile
                        swim, 25 mile bike ride, and a 10k run.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Computer Science</h3>
                    <p>I really like computers. It used to be a novel thing; now it's just a cliche.</p>
                    <p>I love <a href="math.html">math.</a> Computer science is my secret way of doing math but still
                        having some opportunity
                        for employment later in life.</p>
                    <p>My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erd&ouml;s Number</a> is four:
                        Rogaway-Coppersmith-Graham-Erd&ouml;s.</p>
                    <p>My area of research is <a href="crypto.html">cryptography</a> and security. I'm competely
                        obsessed with this stuff
                        now... the most fascinating science I've ever seen; I was lucky to find it as a grad student!
                        I'm also interested in
                        combinatorial algorithms, graph theory, and recreational math. Oh, and my best times at <a
                            href="http://metanoodle.com/minesweeper/">minesweeper</a> are 5, 34, and 112 seconds. And my
                        fastest Rubik's cube
                        solve is 18.11 seconds.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>My Friends</h3>
                    <p>Friends and family are the greatest thing a human being can possess; I'm fortunate to have a
                        bunch of them, but only
                        some currently have a Web page. Here are a few who do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="http://faculty.tcu.edu/snollet">Scott Nollet</a> is one of my closest friends.
                                We've hiked, biked, white-water
                                rafted, played chess, done math, and I've even tricked him into going climbing with me a
                                few times! Lately we've been
                                studying Spanish together a little.</p>
                            <p>Scott is currently Professor of Mathematics at Texas Christian University in Dallas/Ft.
                                Worth.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="http://gaia.ecs.csus.edu/~krovetz/">Ted Krovetz</a> is a faster swimmer than I
                                have ever been. Ted was Phil's
                                other student, so we've worked together quite often. Ted is now at Cal State Sacramento
                                and has three beautiful
                                children.</p>

                            <p><a href=http://www.cs.unr.edu/~tjones>Ty Jones</a> was easily my closest friend in Reno
                                and we still try to keep in
                                touch. He's one of the best volleyball players I've known, beats me at racquetball,
                                golf, and ping-pong every time, but
                                fortunately I can still out-climb him... Ty had his first child, Ava, in early 2006.</p>
